# Nairobi-Uber-Perambulation-Challenge
Road traffic collisions are the number one killer of children and young adults ages 5-29, and 8th leading cause of death worldwide. Post-crash care is one of the five pillars of road safety and a critical component for reducing morbidity and mortality.  When it comes to emergency response to road accidents, every second counts. With heavy traffic patterns and the unique layout of the city, finding the best locations to position emergency responders throughout the day as they wait to be called is critical in a city like Nairobi. Use these findings to place six virtual ambulances around the city, moving them around throughout the day with the goal of minimising the distance travelled when responding to crashes during the test period.
